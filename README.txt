Coursera and Princeton University have offered course Algorithms, Part I by professors Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick.
The course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations.
Specific topics covered include: union-find algorithms; basic iterable data types (stack, queues, and bags); sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, heapsort) and applications; priority queues; binary search trees; red-black trees; hash tables; and symbol-table applications.

Honor Code for this course requires no code to be published. That's the reason why my work is password protected. I can provide passwords on specific request.
